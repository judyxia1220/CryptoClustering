# CryptoClustering

### Overview

Module 19 Challenge

#### About
This challenge examined and predicted if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using python and unsupervised learning. We also determined the differences between using fewer features (through Principal Component Analysis ) and more features in clustering data by K-Means, and found the optimal number of clusters.

#### Analysis
There were no significant differences in determining the optimal value clusters, which is 4 for both original and PCA datasets. Perhaps the small size in data contributed to this minimal impact on the optimal number of clusters. Using fewer features (PCA) however, did help delineate the clusters allowing a clearer distinction between clusters that were outliers. It also separated the clusters more so the data was cleaner and more distinct.
